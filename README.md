This is the repository that contains source code for the [https://dori943.github.io/MELT.github.io/](https://dori943.github.io/MELT.github.io/).

## 🚀 Getting Started
You can run all `.ipynb` files directly in **Google Colab** for easy testing and reproduction.

### Notebook Descriptions
* **`koyha_LoRA_SDXL.ipynb`**: Implementation for training models by applying LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) to SDXL.
* **`MELT_T2I.ipynb`**: The core T2I code showcasing our research results.
* **`SDXL_T2I.ipynb`**: Standard image generation code using the base SDXL 1.0 model.
