# MELT: A Style-Adaptive Multimodal Folktale Generation Framework for Underrepresented Cultures


## 🚀 Getting Started
You can run all `.ipynb` files directly in **Google Colab** for easy testing and reproduction.

### Notebook Descriptions
* **`koyha_LoRA_SDXL.ipynb`**: Implementation for training models by applying LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) to SDXL.
* **`MELT_T2I.ipynb`**: The core T2I code showcasing our research results.
* **`SDXL_T2I.ipynb`**: Standard image generation code using the base SDXL 1.0 model.

## 🛠 Usage Instructions

### Working with `MELT_T2I.ipynb`
To generate images using our proposed method, please follow these steps:
1.  **Upload the `Loras` files**: Upload the requird files to your Colab environment.
2.  **Path Configuration**: Modify the file paths within the code to point to your uploaded LoRA files.
3.  **Customization**: You can customize the output filenames for the generated images directly in the script.
